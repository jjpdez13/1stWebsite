        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up in a small town in the country was amazing and extremely fun. First few years in Phoenix weren't that memorable.

        <h2>Adulthood</h2>
        <p>
            8 years in the USMC was pretty rough. Getting out and 10 years after was rougher. Now on a path of clarity and a lot of fun doing this coding thing.
