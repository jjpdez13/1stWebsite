        <h2>Hometown</h2>

            Phoenix born until 7. Show Low, Arizona from 7-18. The "real" hometown.

        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up in a "small town" in the country was amazing and extremely fun. First few years in Phoenix weren't that memorable. To be honest I grew up 5 miles south of any town (300 people) and down a half mile dirt road in a forest of pine trees.

        <h2>Adulthood</h2>
        <p class="end">
            8 years in the USMC was pretty rough. Getting out and 10 years after was rougher. Now on a path of clarity and a lot of fun doing this coding thing.
